Here are all the towers that are available in the game. You can define tower between #Start and #End.
All tower types must have type, name, price, damage, image and radius given. Attack types must also have damage
and attack speed. Support towers must have radius, damage and speed boosts. Radius tells towers radius in tiles. 
Low speed is 1 and high speed is 5. It can be set higher though. Damage tells how much lifepoints does the tower
reduce from enemy when hit. Add images to Images-folder.
